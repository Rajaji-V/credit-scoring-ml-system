# Credit Scoring Project

This project assesses the creditworthiness of loan applicants using financial and demographic data from the German Credit dataset.

## Project Structure
- `dataset/` — Contains the raw data (`german.data`)
- `src/` — Source code for data processing, modeling, and prediction
- `outputs/` — Model outputs, reports, and results

## Main Steps
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing (using Scikit-Learn Pipeline)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Prediction Script

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train the model: `python src/main.py`
3. Run a prediction: `python src/predict.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for package list

## Dataset
- Source: `dataset/german.data`
